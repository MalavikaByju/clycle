    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Clycle</h2>
        <p>We are seven college students who got tired of seeing perfectly good stuff get thrown away while broke students like us desperately needed those exact items. Clycle is our attempt at fixing this ridiculous situation through a marketplace that actually gets student life.</p>
        <p>"Look, we're just trying to make campus life less wasteful and more affordable. If that makes us idealists, then whatever, at least we're broke idealists with a decent app."</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p><strong>Warm Beige</strong> — background tone for less eye strain and more comfort.</p>
        <p><strong>Earthy Olive</strong> — action buttons and sustainability cues.</p>
        <p><strong>Rich Brown</strong> — grounding color for serious yet approachable content.</p>

    <!-- SEO Philosophy Section -->
    <section id="seo">
        <h2>Our SEO Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We learned that building a cool app means nothing if people can't find it. Our strategy is simple: show up when students are actually searching for what we offer, be genuinely helpful, and build trust over traffic.</p>
        <p>We focus on keywords like <strong>student marketplace</strong>, <strong>campus buy and sell platform</strong>, <strong>student-to-student trading</strong>, and <strong>campus sustainable marketplace</strong> because these represent real problems we're solving.</p>
        <p>Our content plan includes blog posts, category pages, and repair hub guides — each targeting search intent stages from awareness to conversion. By creating helpful content and linking it to our platform, we build topical authority and trust with both students and search engines.</p>
